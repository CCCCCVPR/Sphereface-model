# Sphereface-model
This is the pre-trained model of SphereFace : Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition.
This model is trained on CASIA-Webface and the accuracy on LFW is **99.18%**. 
- Training on Webface with the default setting only got an accuracy of 98.5%ï¼Œ which is much lower than the paper claimed(**~99.26%**). 
- Fixed lambda = 5, kept on training, and got an accuracy of 98.8%.
- Decreased the lambda. Final accuracy is 99.18%.

I think the performance can still be further improved by carefully fine-tuning. Feel free to use this model.
