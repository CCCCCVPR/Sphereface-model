# Sphereface-model
This is the pre-trained model of SphereFace : Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition. The accuracy on LFW is 99.08%. I set the lambda=5 firstly and only got a accuracy of 98.8%. Then, I decreased the lambda and continue finetune. Fortunately, I found the accuracy is increasing.
