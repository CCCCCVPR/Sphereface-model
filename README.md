# Sphereface-model
This is the pre-trained model of SphereFace : Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition.
This model is trained on Webface and the accuracy on LFW is **99.18%**. I set lambda=5 firstly and only got an accuracy of 98.8%ï¼Œ which is much lower than the paper claimed(**~99.26%**). Then, I decreased the lambda and continue training. Fortunately, I found the accuracy is still increasing.

I think the performance can still be further improved by carefully fine-tuning. Feel free to use this model.
# Experiment Results
Train 22000(lambda=3.6, batch_size=170).
