# Sphereface-model
This is the pre-trained model of SphereFace : Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition. The accuracy on LFW is 99.13%. I set the lambda=5 firstly and only got a accuracy of 98.8%ï¼Œ which is much lower than the paper claimed(~99.26%). Then, I decreased the lambda and continue training. Fortunately, I found the accuracy is increasing.
I think the accurracy can still be further improved by carefully fine-tuning. Feel free to use this model.
